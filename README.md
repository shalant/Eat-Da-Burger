# Eat-Da-Burger

## Description
### This handy app allows a user to make a ticket for ordering, preparing, and serving burgers. A user can add a burger in the prompt and it will appear on the left. They can click the devour button, and said burger will move to the right. This would be very handy for a trendy $18 burger bar in a gentrified neighborhood.

## Installation
### Download all files, in terminal run npm install, npm install express, npm install hbs, and npm install mysql. Run the schema and seeds.sql in MySQL. From the command line, type nodemon server.js
